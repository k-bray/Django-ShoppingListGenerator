# Django-ShoppingListGenerator
A work in progress - Django website application for shopping list generator built in Python

This is a project I'm currently working on, to move the Shopping List Generator I've built in Python to a user-friendly website, and allow users to manage their recipe ingredients lists, build a weekly shopping list from these recipes and browse old shopping lists. 

I'm planning to add:
* Capability for users to delete meals once they've been added
* Option to download the shopping list as a CSV file
* Web design and functionality improvements
* Possibly a web scraping application for users to get recipe ingredients from URLs
